Optimise your page performance by showing an image with play button instead of YouTube video embed script. This could be achieved using a simple Short code.

== Description ==

= Introduction =

Avoid loading YouTube player each time your page loads which impacts performance. Using the shortcode provided by this plugin, a banner image with play button will be displayed instead of the YouTube video iframe. This improves the page load time. 
Only after clicking on the play button on the banner image, the embedded YouTube video will be loaded.

Short code Pattern: [eh_optimize_youtube_embed video="youtube_link" banner="banner_image_link_optional" width="560" height="315"]
</p>
<p style="padding-top:1em;">
Example 1 - With Embed Link and Custom Banner: 
[eh_optimize_youtube_embed video="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9bZkp7q19f0" banner="http://static.echonest.com/InfiniteGangnamStyle/psy.png"]
</p>
<p style="padding-top:1em;">
Example 2 - With a normal youtube watch link and no banner (a default banner will be displayed): 
[eh_optimize_youtube_embed video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0"]
</p>
<p style="padding-top:1em;">
Example 3 - With customized width and height for your Video: 
[eh_optimize_youtube_embed video="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0" width="560" height="315"]
